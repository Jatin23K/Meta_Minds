```

### After (SMART Enhanced)
```
1. What specific trends in closing prices can be quantified over the 2020-2024 period, and how do these trends correlate with measurable changes in trading volume during earnings announcement windows?

2. How does the relationship between daily trading volume and price volatility vary across different market conditions, and what actionable insights can be derived for risk management strategies?

3. What measurable patterns emerge when analyzing the correlation between opening price gaps and subsequent intraday price movements, and how might these patterns inform algorithmic trading decisions?
