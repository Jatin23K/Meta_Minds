Notes:
This analysis covers a transformative decade for US aviation including post-recession recovery (2013-2015), industry consolidation (2015-2018), pre-pandemic growth (2018-2019), COVID-19 crisis (2020-2021), and recovery period (2021-2023). Special attention should be paid to carriers showing declining liquidity ratios, negative asset positions, and unsustainable liability growth. The analysis should identify early warning signals of financial distress and distinguish between temporary disruptions versus systemic financial challenges.
